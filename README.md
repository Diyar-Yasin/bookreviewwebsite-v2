# Diyar's Book Reviews

If you're a semi-avid reader like me, you might enjoy my takes on some popular books [here](https://diyar-yasin.github.io/diyars-book-reviews/)!

My first iteration of this website used pure HTML/CSS. This time, it was built using React JS and makes it much easier for me to add new reviews in the future.

You can check out the old website [here](https://diyar-yasin.github.io/BookReviewWebsite/)

## Plans for Diyar's Book Reviews
- Add Github Actions CI/CD pipeline to auto publish to Github Pages
