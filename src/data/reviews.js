    "content": "Before Lovecraft, horror had two flavors for me: gore and jumpscares.The idea that so many people were horror enthusiasts blew my mind. What’s there to love? Am I going to turn the page and be jolted out of my seat with the big, bold letters “BOO!”?\n\nNonetheless, I gave this collection of short stories a try. The experience moved the macabre from two to three dimensions. I discovered an entirely new flavor of horror.\n\nThe concept of God is, quite honestly, the best connection I can draw up. I know, oxymoronic, but stay with me. The type of cosmic entities lurking behind the pages are oftentimes so great that to name them is taboo, and gazing upon their figure drives one to madness. They are monsters so far beyond human comprehension that most of the horror is left to readers' imagination. In the same way that God is unintelligibly powerful, so too are Cthulhu and Nyarlathotep. Part of the interest is in the verbosity of H.P. Lovecraft. He describes non-Euclidean spaces, otherworldly deities, and grotesque vistas. His use of esoteric vocabulary helps keep readers like me feeling estranged.\n\nWhat’s also great is that the fear doesn’t end when you put the book down. Lovecraft leaves you steeped in wonder as to what might really be out there far longer than most horror I’ve seen.\n\nWhether or not you care for the horror genre, this is a must read. This is a collection of works that has inspired the genre to this day and continues to be talked about. This is a classic."

    "content": "Whether you have any large background in physics or not, this book is packed with interesting content that makes you wonder why high school physics wasn’t this fun. This is really the best compliment I can give this book. Professor Hawking expertly illustrates concepts like space-time and quantum physics in a way that is easily digestible by audiences as young as high schoolers (which is when I read it). There isn’t much else to say here, so I’ll tell you about the part that left the largest impact on me. Hawking describes the double-slit experiment, a simple procedure where light is shone onto a paper with two spaced slits and a wall behind it. He concludes the chapter at the climactic realization that a light particle must exist in two different places at the same time for the experiment to make any sense. This stunningly simple experiment, followed by the reasoning to reach this inherently obtuse idea, left me speechless. Well not really, I wasn’t reading out loud or anything. You get it."

    "content": "This book is considered a classic. One that stands the test of time. I disagree. This book sucked. The majority of its pages were chock full of gruesome scenes that left me disgusted. Even if there was purpose behind the grotesque imagery, the author repeatedly redescribed similar scenes. This felt lazy and a way to fill more pages. It reminded me of horror movies that are composed entirely of jumpscares. Nothing substance, just a facade of fear built upon our surface level human instincts to jump at the sudden crash or clamor. Oh and recycling content is a theme, the authors had a lust for describing characters by naming every designer brand. The first time it was done, when we learned the 50+ different lotions Patrick Batemen puts on every morning, it was a unique way to show the reader just how wealthy he was. The 50th time (and this is an estimate not an exaggeration) I was ready to close the book right then and there. The genius may have flown over my head, but I just do not get it."

    "content": "Preface: I am neither a fan of politics nor biographies. This is not my cup of tea x2. However, I still think that this is a good book. Mrs. Obama’s struggles being a mother and First Lady was an interesting look into the world of politics. Unfortunately, I found myself bored quite frequently. It can be quite difficult for a young guy to relate to a mother and wife of a U.S. President. If you are anything like me, I would skip this book entirely. If you love politics or biographies, then you will definitely enjoy her writing."
