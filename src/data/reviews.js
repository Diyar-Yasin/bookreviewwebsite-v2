    "content": "Pygmalion is one of the easiest classics I've ever read. It still comes stuffed with the wordiness of older books but for some reason, that doesn't make it much harder to hold your attention. Shaw writes about a poor flower girl who gets taught how to speak politely by an upper class Englishman. Basically taking her from rags to riches. There's a lot of interesting socio-economic ideas that are brought up because of this. It's not strictly better to live in high society, for example. It's also supposed to be a romantic comedy, which the humour just flew over my head if I'm being honest. It's a play so it's likely a combination of me reading a 2-dimensional script and how old the book is. George was very economical with what got script time and what didn't. He didn't even go into detail as to how he trains her to speak proper English. I haven't read any other George Bernard Shaw books but I definitely will because of this play."

Anyways, :re picks up after Ken Kaneki is captured by the CCG. His memories are lost and is trained to become a CCG investigator. Oh how the tables have turned. We follow his life leading a new QS squad of half ghoul investigators. At the same time Kaneki, now known as Haise Sasaki, slowly begins to uncover his past. There are multiple interesting revelations throughout the 16 volumes. What I simultaneously liked and disliked was how the story reminded me of a typical Marvel superhero film. It didn't make any new ground in that regard, but it also didn't make any major mistakes. Which as far as anime and manga are concerned, is pretty good."

    "content": "Before Lovecraft, horror had two flavors for me: gore and jumpscares.The idea that so many people were horror enthusiasts blew my mind. What’s there to love? Am I going to turn the page and be jolted out of my seat with the big, bold letters “BOO!”?\n\nNonetheless, I gave this collection of short stories a try. The experience moved the macabre from two to three dimensions. I discovered an entirely new flavor of horror.\n\nThe concept of God is, quite honestly, the best connection I can draw up. I know, oxymoronic, but stay with me. The type of cosmic entities lurking behind the pages are oftentimes so great that to name them is taboo, and gazing upon their figure drives one to madness. They are monsters so far beyond human comprehension that most of the horror is left to readers' imagination. In the same way that God is unintelligibly powerful, so too are Cthulhu and Nyarlathotep. Part of the interest is in the verbosity of H.P. Lovecraft. He describes non-Euclidean spaces, otherworldly deities, and grotesque vistas. His use of esoteric vocabulary helps keep readers like me feeling estranged.\n\nWhat’s also great is that the fear doesn’t end when you put the book down. Lovecraft leaves you steeped in wonder as to what might really be out there far longer than most horror I’ve seen.\n\nWhether or not you care for the horror genre, this is a must read. This is a collection of works that has inspired the genre to this day and continues to be talked about. This is a classic."

    "content": "If you've read any of the other reviews on this site, you'd notice that I rarely bring up specific examples within a book. The majority of reviews are based on a general feel. That is partly because I am not looking to make writing reviews into a job and partly because by the time I get to reviewing a book, it has been so long that I've forgotten it. That being said, I finished this series a week before writing this review. And still, I can't tell you what happened. Not because it's forgettable, mind you. There is simply so much happening. Tatsuki Fujimoto crafts high octane stories that feel like waking up from a weird dream. It's really only after finishing a volume that you understand it. The moment to moment is like riding a supercar into a ninety-degree right turn, after two one-eighties. In the best way possible, I had anxiety throughout this read. Fun and energetic, you enter willfully through one end and spit out on the other."

    "content": "Whether you have any large background in physics or not, this book is packed with interesting content that makes you wonder why high school physics wasn’t this fun. This is really the best compliment I can give this book. Professor Hawking expertly illustrates concepts like space-time and quantum physics in a way that is easily digestible by audiences as young as high schoolers (which is when I read it). There isn’t much else to say here, so I’ll tell you about the part that left the largest impact on me. Hawking describes the double-slit experiment, a simple procedure where light is shone onto a paper with two spaced slits and a wall behind it. He concludes the chapter at the climactic realization that a light particle must exist in two different places at the same time for the experiment to make any sense. This stunningly simple experiment, followed by the reasoning to reach this inherently obtuse idea, left me speechless. Well not really, I wasn’t reading out loud or anything. You get it."

    },
    "content": "This book is considered a classic. One that stands the test of time. I disagree. This book sucked. The majority of its pages were chock full of gruesome scenes that left me disgusted. Even if there was purpose behind the grotesque imagery, the author repeatedly redescribed similar scenes. This felt lazy and a way to fill more pages. It reminded me of horror movies that are composed entirely of jumpscares. Nothing substance, just a facade of fear built upon our surface level human instincts to jump at the sudden crash or clamor. Oh and recycling content is a theme, the authors had a lust for describing characters by naming every designer brand. The first time it was done, when we learned the 50+ different lotions Patrick Batemen puts on every morning, it was a unique way to show the reader just how wealthy he was. The 50th time (and this is an estimate not an exaggeration) I was ready to close the book right then and there. The genius may have flown over my head, but I just do not get it."

    },
    "content": "Preface: I am neither a fan of politics nor biographies. This is not my cup of tea x2. However, I still think that this is a good book. Mrs. Obama’s struggles being a mother and First Lady was an interesting look into the world of politics. Unfortunately, I found myself bored quite frequently. It can be quite difficult for a young guy to relate to a mother and wife of a U.S. President. If you are anything like me, I would skip this book entirely. If you love politics or biographies, then you will definitely enjoy her writing."

    "content": "Trevor Noah is the only biography I've read that I would even consider reading again. Not only does he have something worthwhile to say, he's also a talented storyteller. That is quite rare in biographies. From what I've seen, any biographies, even if they do have something to say, fail to do so elegantly. These people have lived bold and interesting lives. That does not necessarily include a life of writing. Expecting them to be good at it isn't fair. That does not, however, exempt them from judgment. That being said, Trevor is a sole proprietor in the good biography writing scene, from the small selection of biographies I've read. His life is tragic and emotional, but also vibrant and hopeful. This is a book to read not just for learning of appartheid in South Africa, but also for pleasure. That really is the best praise I can give a biography."

    "content": "I Am Legend is a very scientific book about vampiric apocalypses. It takes you through as if you were the main character. In the sense that not even he understands what is going on at first. This helped me feel invested in the fate of our protagonist. This was a really fun read and a unique piece in the horror genre. I especially like the ending, which is different (and better) to the movie I Am Legend starring Will Smith."

    },
    "content": "My first introduction to Japanese novelists as well as one of the best books I have ever read. Oba Yozo, our narrator and protagonist, is an alien in human skin. He lives a constant lie, pretending to understand common social interactions and playing the class clown in an attempt to seem normal. His biggest fear is that others might catch on to his charade. This detached protagonist’s perspective is super interesting. Yozo describes the world around him in the bleakest, blandest way possible. Yet, his descriptions are profoundly interesting. Dazai is a master in both story-telling and writing. He could write a whole chapter on the dullness of a block of concrete."

    "content": "The Odyssey is one of the best classics I've ever read. Passed down orally for centuries before being written down on paper, this book has stood more than the test of time. I usually find classics to be worth the read, but difficult to get through. It might be the difference in language between then and today. This is both a great read and a valuable one. Reading this before Madeline Miller's The Song of Achilles and Circe made her writing all the better."

    },
    "content": "Self-help is a category I find myself indulging in far too much. Whenever I find myself in a slump, even if it's just for a couple hours, I turn to books and videos of this kind. That is to say, I’ve seen a lot of what this genre has to offer. Thus I am confident in saying that this book is sh*t. Mark adores curse words like that. He sounds like a kid who just learned them. Every chapter is stuffed full of filler vulgarity. Like, yeah we get it, you don’t see these words in books often. It loses its charm by the second chapter. At the risk of coming off as egotistical, Mark talks down to his readers. His analogies are simple. Not in a good, “I can easily understand this” way, but in a, “this is dumb” type of way. It’s as if he decided his entire audience would be mindless facebook users with the attention span of goldfishes. Maybe I am being too harsh on the book. There were a few interesting points he mentions that I do think are useful. The only problem is, I don’t want to do anything he says out of spite. I’d go so far as to say this book is disrespectful to its readers."

Uncertainty as to where her next meal will come from, if her parents are traitors to the Great Leader, if she can escape North Korea, and eventually rejoin the whole family together in South Korea. The way of life for North Koreans living in famine is deeply interesting. And sad. Although I find it difficult to empathize with her (as I do with most biographies). Not many can, I think. Her experiences are too outlandish for those of us enjoying modern civilization to be able to comprehend. When both her parents were forced to leave her and her sister behind in their hometown, accounts of her spending the days finding flowers and insects to eat was especially harsh. While this was not a page-turner, it is an important read. This is real and happening right now. No amount of explaining her struggles will do this book justice. You just gotta read it."

    "content": "Sleep always gets the short end of the stick in the face of everything else. Finishing an assignment, playing games, watching youtube. I readily sacrifice my sleep for my entertainment. Part of me believes that the extra time is just that, extra time. Mathew Walker says otherwise. He fills the pages with interesting knowledge on the reasons we sleep, how it works, and the cost of not getting enough of it. The reality behind sleep deprivation is severe enough to jolt me back into getting a full night's rest. I started being actively interested in getting the right amount of sleep, at the right times of day, consistently. This book is probably important to read at least once a year. I say probably because I have only read it once, and now that it's been a couple of months I can see my poor sleeping habits beginning to resurface. This is no textbook, Mathew's writing is clear but interesting. You won't be reading a textbook here."
